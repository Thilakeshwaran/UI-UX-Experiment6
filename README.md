#### 3. Creating Scenarios
Selected User Story:

As a working professional, I want to book my regular doctor quickly, so that I don’t waste time.

Scenario:

Ravi is working late on a Wednesday evening when he starts feeling throat pain. He remembers his regular ENT doctor and wants to book an appointment immediately. He opens the healthcare app during a short break. The app homepage displays a “Book Again” section showing his frequently visited doctor. Feeling relieved, Ravi taps on the doctor’s name. The available time slots appear instantly. He selects a slot for the next morning and confirms the booking. The app sends him a confirmation message and directions to the clinic. Ravi feels confident and stress-free knowing his appointment is secured within seconds.
